# NHS Hospital Waiting Times Analysis (Janâ€“Mar 2025)

## Overview
This project analyses fictional NHS hospital waiting times and patient backlogs over a three-month period (January to March 2025). It aims to demonstrate data cleaning, pivot table creation, and data visualisation skills using Excel.

## Dataset
The dataset contains:
- Average waiting time (in days) for patients at three hospitals (Bradford, Leeds, Shipley)
- Number of patients waiting over the target time for treatment

## Contents
- **Raw_Data**: The original dataset with hospital, month, average waiting time, and patients waiting over target
- **Pivot_Analysis**: Two pivot tables summarising average waiting times and patient backlogs by hospital and month
- **Charts**: Line charts visualising trends for average waiting times and patients waiting over target, accompanied by insight summaries

## Key Insights
- Leeds consistently has the shortest average waiting times and lowest patient backlogs, showing steady improvement.
- Shipley has the highest waiting times and patient backlogs, indicating potential areas for operational improvement.
- Bradford remains stable with moderate waiting times and backlogs.

## How to Use
1. Open the Excel file.
2. Navigate through the sheets to explore the raw data, pivot tables, and charts.
3. Use the pivot tables to filter or drill down into specific months or hospitals.
4. Review the charts and text boxes for summary insights.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data organisation and cleaning in Excel  
- Creating and customizing pivot tables  
- Building effective line charts  
- Writing concise data insights  
- Project structuring and documentation

## Next Steps
- Expand dataset to include more hospitals and longer timeframes  
- Add predictive analytics or forecasting  
- Automate data updates using Power Query or other tools
